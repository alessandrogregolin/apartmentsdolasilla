She also had an armor made by court armorers, and incredibly effective bows that resisted anyone, even in the tough melee. The Silver Lake offered reeds for arrows, which were more infallible than you could wish for. Thus, well equipped, Dolasilla, together with the marmots, quickly defeated the enemy. The victorious princess was carried in triumph by her people through the impassable path. When she arrived, Dolasilla was crowned by her father, the king, with the splendid Rajetta. Thus began a period of prosperity for the kingdom of Fanes and a wonderful chapter in its history"
